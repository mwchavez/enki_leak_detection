# Cloud Backend for Hybrid Leak Detection System
**CSEC 4390 – Senior Design Practicum | Spring 2026**

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the **cloud infrastructure** component of a hybrid, multi-modal water leak detection system. The full system is a joint effort between an Engineering team (responsible for physical sensors and edge AI) and a CIS/Cybersecurity team (responsible for cloud backend and data pipeline).

Our role is to build the cloud-side of the pipeline: receiving sensor data from distributed IoT nodes, storing and processing it in real time, triggering alerts when anomalies are detected, and visualizing results on a live dashboard.

> **In plain terms:** the Engineering team builds the physical sensors and puts them near pipes. Our team builds the cloud system that receives those sensor readings, figures out if a leak is happening, and sends an alert — all within 5 seconds.

        │
        │  MQTT over TLS (port 8883)

  AWS IoT Core
  (MQTT Broker + Rules Engine)
        │
        │  IoT Rule → DynamoDB
        ▼
   DynamoDB
 (Raw sensor storage)
        │
        │  DynamoDB Streams → CloudWatch Metrics
        ▼
   CloudWatch
 (Threshold alerting, monitoring & logs)
        │
        ▼
  SNS / Email Alert          Web Dashboard
  (< 5 sec latency)        (Live Visualization)
```

### Why Each Service Was Chosen

| AWS Service | Role | Why It's Used |
|---|---|---|
| **IoT Core** | MQTT broker & device gateway | Managed service; handles device auth with certificates so we don't have to build our own broker |
| **DynamoDB** | Raw sensor data storage | NoSQL, scales automatically, fast writes for high-frequency sensor data |
| **CloudWatch** | Threshold alerting, monitoring & logs | Native AWS monitoring tool; configurable metric alarms eliminate the need for custom processing code in this controlled environment |
| **SNS** | Alert notifications | Delivers email/SMS alerts when CloudWatch thresholds are exceeded |

## 📡 Sensor Data Schema

Each IoT device publishes JSON payloads to AWS IoT Core on the topic `leaksense/data`:

```json
{
  "device_id": "node-001",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T14:23:00Z",
  "moisture": 72.4,
  "temperature": 21.3,
  "vibration": 0.12,
  "acoustic": 340.5,
  "location": "bathroom-sink"
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `moisture` – relative humidity/moisture percentage near the sensor node
- `temperature` – ambient temperature in Celsius
- `vibration` – vibration intensity (g-force units)
- `acoustic` – sound frequency reading in Hz (pipe resonance detection)
- `location` – human-readable label for the sensor's physical placement

---

## 🚨 Alert Logic

CloudWatch Metric Alarms evaluate sensor data against threshold rules and trigger SNS notifications when conditions are met:

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| High moisture | `moisture > 80%` | Trigger alert |
| Temperature spike | `temp change > 5°C in 60s` | Trigger alert |
| Acoustic anomaly | `acoustic > 500 Hz sustained` | Trigger alert |
| Combined signal | Any 2+ thresholds crossed | High-priority alert |

> **Note:** The system uses rule-based threshold detection rather than ML for this controlled environment. This keeps the pipeline reliable and debuggable for a single-semester project. ML-based detection is scoped as future work for more complex, multi-building deployments.

## 🔐 Security Practices

- IAM user with least-privilege permissions (no root account usage)
- Certificate-based mutual TLS authentication for all IoT devices
- Device policies scoped to specific MQTT topics only
- Secrets (certificates, WiFi credentials) excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
