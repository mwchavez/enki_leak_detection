## 🏗️ System Overview

Enki is a hybrid leak detection system with **two independent detection paths** designed to work together:

**Path 1 — Distributed Monitoring (Cloud)**  
Fixed sensor nodes attached to pipes collect environmental readings and transmit them to AWS via MQTT. The cloud pipeline stores the data, evaluates it against threshold rules, and sends email alerts when anomalies are detected.

**Path 2 — Handheld Inspection (Edge ML)**  
A portable handheld device with onboard sensors and a TensorFlow Lite model runs inference directly on the ESP32. A technician holds the device against a pipe and receives an immediate "Leak" or "No Leak" result on the LCD screen — no cloud connection required.

## ☁️ AWS Cloud Services

| AWS Service | Role | Why It's Used |
|---|---|---|
| **IoT Core** | MQTT broker & device gateway | Managed service; handles device authentication with X.509 certificates — no custom broker needed |
| **DynamoDB** | Raw sensor data storage | NoSQL with on-demand scaling; handles high-frequency sensor writes with single-digit millisecond latency |
| **CloudWatch** | Threshold alerting & monitoring | Native AWS monitoring; configurable metric alarms eliminate the need for custom processing code |
| **SNS** | Alert notifications | Delivers email alerts when CloudWatch alarm thresholds are exceeded |
| **IAM** | Access control | Least-privilege roles scoped per service; IoT Rules Engine assumes a role to write to DynamoDB |
| **AWS CDK** | Infrastructure as Code | Entire cloud stack defined in Python; parameterized and portable across AWS accounts |

---

## 🔧 Edge & ML Stack

| Component | Role | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **ESP32-S3** | Microcontroller | Drives both fixed nodes and handheld device |
| **SHTC3** | Temperature & humidity sensor | Detects environmental changes near pipes |
| **MPU6050** | Vibration/motion sensor | Detects pipe vibration anomalies |
| **INMP441** | I2S digital microphone | Acoustic sensing for pipe resonance detection |
| **HC-SR04** | Ultrasonic sensor | Proximity-based moisture/leak detection |
| **TensorFlow Lite** | Edge ML framework | Runs leak classification model on the handheld ESP32 |

---

## 📡 Sensor Data Schema

Each fixed node publishes JSON payloads via MQTT to the topic pattern `leaksensor/node-XX/data`:

```json
{
  "device_id": "node-01",
  "timestamp": 1709312580,
  "moisture": 72.4,
  "temperature": 21.3,
  "vibration": 0.12,
  "acoustic": 340.5
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `device_id` | String | Unique identifier for the sensor node (partition key) |
| `timestamp` | Number | Unix epoch in seconds (sort key) |
| `moisture` | Number | Relative humidity/moisture percentage near the node |
| `temperature` | Number | Ambient temperature in Celsius |
| `vibration` | Number | Vibration intensity (g-force units) |
| `acoustic` | Number | Sound frequency in Hz (pipe resonance detection) |

---

## 🚨 Alert Logic

CloudWatch Metric Alarms evaluate incoming sensor data against threshold rules and trigger SNS notifications:

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| High moisture | `moisture > 80%` | Trigger alert |
| Temperature spike | `temp change > 5°C in 60s` | Trigger alert |
| Acoustic anomaly | `acoustic > 500 Hz sustained` | Trigger alert |
| Combined signal | Any 2+ thresholds crossed | High-priority alert |

> **Design Decision:** The cloud pipeline uses rule-based threshold detection rather than ML. In a controlled environment with known baselines, CloudWatch alarms provide reliable, debuggable alerting. ML-based cloud detection is scoped as future work for larger-scale, multi-building deployments.

## 🔐 Security Practices

- **No root account usage** — IAM user with scoped permissions only
- **Certificate-based mutual TLS** — X.509 certificates authenticate every IoT device
- **Least-privilege IoT policies** — device policies scoped to specific MQTT topics (`leaksensor/node-*/data`)
- **IAM Roles over IAM Users** — services assume temporary roles; IoT Rules Engine has only `dynamodb:PutItem` permission on the sensor table
- **Secrets excluded from version control** — certificates, WiFi credentials, and ARNs kept out of the repo via `.gitignore`
- **CDK parameterization** — certificate ARNs passed as `CfnParameter` at deploy time, not hardcoded
